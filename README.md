# Stock-market-portfolio

This project is hosted through AWS Amplify and can be found here: https://main.d8a7tm8hrx5iu.amplifyapp.com/

This app's purpose was to teach me how to use AWS and its services, including Lambda and API Gateway for retrieving stock data, AWS Amplify to host, and DynamoDB to store the stock data. 

You can see the Lambda functions in the API here: https://github.com/RyanVSD/stock-market-portfolio-lambda
